This repository contains a general-purpose web UI for Tinkerbell.
It allows you to manage your hardware, template, and workflows from a single place.

## Experimental

This repository is Experimental meaning that it's based on untested ideas or techniques and not yet established or finalized or involves a radically new and innovative style! This means that support is best effort (at best!) and we strongly encourage you to NOT use this in production.

## Prerequisite

-   You have already setup the Tinkerbell stack (the provisioner, as we generally know it).

## Get Started

### Clone the repository with:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tinkerbell/portal.git && cd portal
```

### Environment settings

-   Update the `.env` file as per your environment setup.
-   If you plan to use TLS with tink-wizard, set `ALLOW_INSECURE` to `false`. Default is `true`.

### Starting server

-   In order to host a secure server, please update the CA and server configuration in respective files under `/tls`.
-   However, the definitions are preset to give you a quick start with `localhost`.
-   Once you have updated the `/tls` definitions, you can generate the certificate with:

```
$ make certs
```

-   You can now start the server by executing the following:

```
$ make run
```

-   You can now access tink-wizard at [http://localhost:7676](http://localhost:7676) or [https://localhost:7676](https://localhost:7676).
